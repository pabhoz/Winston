## About Winston

**Winston** is a command line assistant created with **JavaScript** on **NodeJS** that also uses **Shell commands** to make the process of managing your projects **easier** or at least **more efficient**.

**Winston** is configured for your use on first launch and will allow you to create additional configuration files in the projects within the selected workspace so you can create actions or execution strings, for example, during the AwesomeCode project every day you see yourself changing directory to it, where you find the Client and Backend folders, now it's time to open each one with VSCode and then run a nodemon, or npm run start or any other script... well now with winston you can create your own pipelines to do all that without moving a single finger! well, at least one to press the chosen option and **ENTER**.

Winston is initially intended for MacOS and Linux systems only.
